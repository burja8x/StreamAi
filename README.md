# StreamAi
StreamAi platform on Ethereum (Smart contract part)

The idea was to create a platform through which users would be able to lease containers (Docker). Users will also be able to sell containers. Containers will contain Ai model and will get as input video stream. Everything should be done in a decentralized way if possible.

To run python scripts you need to have the Web3.py library installed.
In file sc2.py you need to change some lines. You need to add private keys (in a comment is code how to generate accounts), smart contract address, and Infura API key...

In a smart contract, you need to change some parameters.
